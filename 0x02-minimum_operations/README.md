# Minimum Operations Project

For this project, you will need to understand several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only “Copy All” and “Paste” operations. Here is a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful:

## Concepts Needed

### Dynamic Programming

Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.

- [Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)

### Prime Factorization

Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.

- [Prime Factorization (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x15d8a5c1:division/x15d8a5c1:prime-factorization/v/prime-factorization)

### Code Optimization

Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient solution.

### Greedy Algorithms

The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step.

- [Greedy Algorithms (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)

### Basic Python Programming

Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.

- [Python Functions (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)

## Example

Here is a simple example to illustrate the concept:

```python
def min_operations(n):
    operations = 0
    factor = 2
    while n > 1:
        while n % factor == 0:
            operations += factor
            n //= factor
        factor += 1
    return operations

# Example usage
print(min_operations(9))  # Output: 6 (Copy All, Paste, Paste, Paste)
```

This example demonstrates how to use prime factorization to determine the minimum number of operations.
