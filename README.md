## Concepts Needed

### Dynamic Programming

Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.

### Prime Factorization

Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.

### Code Optimization

Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient solution.
