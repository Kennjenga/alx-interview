# 0. Island Perimeter

## Project Overview

The "Island Perimeter" project involves calculating the perimeter of a single island within a grid. The grid is represented by a 2D array of integers, where `1` represents land and `0` represents water. The goal is to determine the perimeter by analyzing the grid and applying logical conditions to count the edges that form the perimeter of the island.

## Key Concepts

### 2D Arrays (Matrices)

- **Accessing and Iterating**: You need to access and iterate over elements in a 2D array. This involves using nested loops to traverse the grid.
- **Navigating Adjacent Cells**: Understanding how to move horizontally and vertically to adjacent cells is crucial for checking the perimeter conditions.

### Conditional Logic

- **Determining Perimeter Contribution**: Apply conditions to check if a cell contributes to the perimeter. A land cell (`1`) contributes to the perimeter if it is on the grid boundary or adjacent to a water cell (`0`).

### Counting Techniques

- **Counting Edges**: Develop a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter. This involves checking each land cell and its neighbors.

### Problem-Solving Strategies

- **Breaking Down the Problem**: Identify land cells and calculate their contribution to the perimeter by breaking the problem into smaller tasks.

### Python Programming

- **Nested Loops**: Use nested loops to iterate over the grid cells.
- **Conditional Statements**: Use conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.

## Example

Consider the following grid:

```
[
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0]
]
```

The perimeter of the island can be calculated as follows:

- The cell at (0,1) contributes 3 edges (top, left, right).
- The cell at (1,0) contributes 2 edges (top, left).
- The cell at (1,1) contributes 0 edges (all neighbors are land).
- The cell at (1,2) contributes 1 edge (right).
- The cell at (2,1) contributes 2 edges (bottom, left).
- The cell at (3,0) contributes 2 edges (bottom, left).
- The cell at (3,1) contributes 1 edge (bottom).

Total perimeter = 3 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 11
