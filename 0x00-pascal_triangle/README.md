# Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two directly above it. It starts with a 1 at the top, and the edges are always 1. Here is an example of the first few rows:

```
    1
     1 1
    1 2 1
   1 3 3 1
  1 4 6 4 1
```

## Python Algorithms

Python algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems, implemented using the Python programming language. They can range from simple sorting algorithms to complex machine learning algorithms. Some common examples include:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort)
- Search algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic programming (e.g., Fibonacci sequence)

Python's readability and extensive libraries make it a popular choice for implementing algorithms.
